2.09 2014-05-30

    - Uploaded source code to GitHub and included repository URLs in metadata.

    - Included META.json file in addition to META.yml.

    - Set minimum required ExtUtils::MakeMaker version to 6.64 to ensure that
      all parameters used are supported, to save jumping through hoops to
      support earlier versions.  (This should not be a problem since
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.64 is easily installed into Perl 5.8.1 and above,
      that being the whole point of the new choice of minimum supported Perl
      version.)

    - Set minimum required Perl version to 5.8.1.  This is in line with the
      minimum requirement of the "Perl Toolchain".

2.08 2010-09-20

      into the t/ folder.  [CPAN RT#61369]

2.06 2009-01-20

    - Fixed make_encmap to avoid spurious output when there is an error with
      the input file.  [CPAN RT#41854]

      Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>]

    - Updated the maps iso-8859-2.xml through iso-8859-9.xml and added the maps

      <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>]

    - Updated the map windows-1250.xml and added the maps windows-1252.xml

      <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>]

2.01 2007-07-24

    - Fixed crash at end of test script when using Perl 5.6.x.  (The crash was
      actually due to a bug in perl that is fixed as of Perl 5.8.0 at least, so
      the test script is simply modified to not tickle that bug.)

    - Clarified the copyright notices.  Only the *changes* in version 2.x are my
      copyright.

2.00 2007-07-18

    - Fixed bin/compile_encoding to run with Perl 5.9.x by using restricted
      hashes instead of pseudo-hashes (which have been removed from Perl 5.9.x).

    - Fixed accidental variable interpolation in Encoding.pm.

    - Fixed case of $ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION in Makefile.PL so that
      ABSTRACT_FROM and AUTHOR get set when intended.

    - Added LICENSE to Makefile.PL.

1.01 1998-12-26

    - Added PREREQ_PM to Makefile.PL.

    - Added x-euc-jp-jisx0221 and x-euc-jp-unicode to maps.  [Yoshida Masato
      <yoshidam@inse.co.jp>]

    - Removed the Shift_JIS encoding and replaced it with four variations and an
      explanatory message.  [MURATA Makoto <murata@apsdc.ksp.fujixerox.co.jp>]
