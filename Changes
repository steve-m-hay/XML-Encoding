Revision history for Perl extension XML::Encoding.

2.02 29 Jun 2008
	- Added manual pages supplied by Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>
	  for compile_encoding and make_encmap.
2.01 24 Jul 2007
	- Fixed crash at end of test script when using perl-5.6.x. (The crash
	  was actually due to a bug in perl that is fixed as of perl-5.8.0 at
	  least, so the test script is simply modified to not tickle that bug.)
	- Clarified the copyright notices. Only the *changes* in version 2.x are
	  my copyright.
2.00 18 Jul 2007
	- Fixed bin/compile_encoding to run with perl-5.9.x by using restricted
	  hashes instead of pseudo-hashes (which have been removed from
	  perl-5.9.x)
	- Fixed accidental variable interpolation in Encoding.pm
	- Fixed case of $ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION in Makefile.PL so that
	  ABSTRACT_FROM and AUTHOR get set when intended
	- Added LICENSE to Makefile.PL
1.01
	- Added PREREQ_PM to Makefile.PL
	- Added x-euc-jp-jisx0221 and x-euc-jp-unicode from
	  Yoshida Masato <yoshidam@inse.co.jp> to maps
	- With the advice of MURATA Makoto <murata@apsdc.ksp.fujixerox.co.jp>,
	  removed the Shift_JIS encoding and replaced it with 4 variations
	  he provided. He also provided an explanatory message.
