Revision history for Perl extension XML::Encoding.

2.08 20 Sep 2010
	- Changed test script to use Test::More, renamed it to test.t and moved
	  it into the t/ folder. (Fixes [cpan #61369].)
	- Moved the perl module into the lib/ folder.
2.07 29 Jan 2009
	- Minor correction to POD from Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>.
2.06 20 Jan 2009
	- Fixed make_encmap to avoid spurious output when there is an error with
	  the input file. (Fixes [cpan #41854].)
2.05 11 Sep 2008
	- Changed the shebang line in the two scripts to be less specific. Thanks
	  to Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de> for the suggestion.
2.04 06 Sep 2008
	- Incorporated a patch from Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de> which
	  updates the maps iso-8859-2.xml to iso-8859-9.xml and adds the maps
	  iso-8859-1.xml, iso-8859-10.xml, iso-8859-11.xml, iso-8859-13.xml to
	  iso-8859-16.xml and windows-1251.xml.
	- Updated the map windows-1250.xml and added the maps windows-1252.xml to
	  windows-1258.xml using data from ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS.
2.03 08 Jul 2008
	- Improved POD formatting of compile_encoding and make_encmap manual pages,
	  courtesy of a patch from Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>.
2.02 29 Jun 2008
	- Added manual pages supplied by Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>
	  for compile_encoding and make_encmap.
2.01 24 Jul 2007
	- Fixed crash at end of test script when using perl-5.6.x. (The crash
	  was actually due to a bug in perl that is fixed as of perl-5.8.0 at
	  least, so the test script is simply modified to not tickle that bug.)
	- Clarified the copyright notices. Only the *changes* in version 2.x are
	  my copyright.
2.00 18 Jul 2007
	- Fixed bin/compile_encoding to run with perl-5.9.x by using restricted
	  hashes instead of pseudo-hashes (which have been removed from
	  perl-5.9.x)
	- Fixed accidental variable interpolation in Encoding.pm
	- Fixed case of $ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION in Makefile.PL so that
	  ABSTRACT_FROM and AUTHOR get set when intended
	- Added LICENSE to Makefile.PL
1.01
	- Added PREREQ_PM to Makefile.PL
	- Added x-euc-jp-jisx0221 and x-euc-jp-unicode from
	  Yoshida Masato <yoshidam@inse.co.jp> to maps
	- With the advice of MURATA Makoto <murata@apsdc.ksp.fujixerox.co.jp>,
	  removed the Shift_JIS encoding and replaced it with 4 variations
	  he provided. He also provided an explanatory message.
